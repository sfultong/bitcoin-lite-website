  <h1>Bitcoin Maximalism</h1>
  <p>Bitcoin's network effect is often cited as a reason that Bitcoin will remain the preferred cryptocurrency above all others. But what exactly is the network effect? I believe it can be broken down into three parts</p>

  <h2>The Hash Rate</h2>
  <p>Bitcoin has an extreme amount of specialized computing hardware that mines blocks and helps keep the network safe. If you believe that cryptocurrency must be based on proof-of-work to remain secure, then bitcoin is the most secure cryptocurrency by far.</p>

  <h2>The Infrastructure</h2>
  <p>Companies have invested the time and money it takes to develop software that allows them to utilize the bitcoin network. If they want to utilize other cryptocurrency networks, they may need to invest a similar amount, depending upon how similar the new cryptocurrency is to bitcoin.</p>

  <h2>The Ledger</h2>
  <p>Cryptocurrency is a relatively new phenomenon. Why does cryptocurrency have value?</p>
  <p>To attempt to answer this question, I'm going to break cryptocurrency into two parts: the code and the data (the blockchain). The code has value if the data has value, and much has been written about the value of the technology of the code. But why does the data have value? Why is a bitcoin worth anything if it's just data with no "intrinsic" value?</p>
  <p>Money is a social construct; it consists of a community and a set of rules that the community abides by.
