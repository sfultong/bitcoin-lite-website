	  <h1>The Ledger Unification Principle</h1>
	  <p>All new cryptocurrency blockchains should contain a premine that gives existing cryptocurrency holders a stake. That stake should be proportional to their value in U.S. Dollars (as that is currently the most stable measure of value in the world). The easiest way to do this is to take snapshots of existing cryptocurrency ledgers. Since cyptocurrency is based on public key cryptography, holders in these ledgers retain ownership in the snapshot by way of their private key.</p>

	  <h2>The "Fair" Distribution Problem</h2>
	  <p>As currency is a social construct, it is important that everyone in the currency community agree that the distribution of currency is more or less fair. There are two main approaches to that: egalitarianism and preserving the status quo. The Ledger Unification Principle takes the status quo approach. If a person has invested a particular amount of value into cryptocurrency tokens, they should have a proportional amount of value in all new cryptocurrencies. This way, those who have shown the most investment interest in the past are given a reason to support the newer cryptocurrencies in the future.</p>

	  <h2>Cryptocurrency as a reliable investment</h2>
	  <p>Up until now, the vast majority of new cryptocurrency blockchains have either started from scratch or with a premine given to developers or angel investors. This has meant that cryptocurrency investors are always scrambling to invest in the next greatest thing, which will be based on unproven code that may have fatal flaws that leave their investment worthless. It also means that when current cryptocurrency becomes obsolete, complacent investors in that technology may find their wealth shrinking as investors to flee to newer, better technology.</p>
	  <p>In an environment where it's not safe to invest in newer or older cryptocurrencies, many smart investors have preferred to wait until the field has matured, and a clear winner has emerged.</p>
	  <p>The Ledger Unification Principle will alleviate the risk of obsolescence for old cryptocurrency investment, and the need to scramble to buy into every promising new technology, for fear of being left out.</p>

	  <h2>Reduction of Infighting</h2>
	  <p>There is currently hostility between different cryptocurrency communities, simply because one community gaining value or mindshare often means that another community is losing value or mindshare. Rather than unbiased evaluation of technical merits of each cryptocurrency, we see advocates pumping out propaganda to protect their existing investments. The Ledger Unification Principle looks to reduce infighting by mirroring existing investments in the genesis of each new blockchain.</p>
